        <h2><u>History</u></h2>
        <article>
            <h3>Early beginnings</h3>
            <p>The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are
                one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones
                pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable
                line up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards,
                bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary
                leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. Jagger and Richards
                became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction
                that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully. Rooted in blues and early rock and roll,
                the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964,
                becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found
                greater success with their own material, such as "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" (1965), "Get Off of My
                Cloud" (1965), and "Paint It Black" (1966) became international number one hits. Aftermath (1966)
                their first entirely original album is considered by The Daily Telegraph to be the most important of
                their formative records. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as "Jumpin'
                Jack Flash" (1968) and "Honky Tonk Women" (1969), and albums such as Beggars Banquet (1968), featuring
                "Sympathy for the Devil", and Let It Bleed (1969), featuring "You Can't Always Get What You Want" and
                "Gimme Shelter". Let It Bleed was the first of five consecutive number one albums in the UK.</p>

            <h3>Musical Development</h3>
            <p>The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres into their own collective sound. Throughout
                the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference to a reliance
                on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R&B, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world
                music exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka as well as traditional
                English styles that use stringed instruments such as harps. Brian Jones experimented with the use of
                non-traditional instruments, such as the sitar and slide guitar, in their early days. The group started
                out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording cover
                songs. The feuds between Jagger and Richards originated in the 1970s when Richards was a heroin
                addict, resulting in Jagger managing the band's affairs for many years. When Richards got
                himself off heroin and became more present in decision making, Jagger was not used to it and did not
                like having his authority diminished. This led to the period Richards has referred to as "World War
                III". Musical collaboration between members of the band and supporting musicians was key, due to the
                fluid lineups typically experienced by the band in the studio, as tracks tended to be recorded "by
                whatever members of the group happened to be around at the time of the sessions". Over time, Jagger
                has developed into the template for rock frontmen and, with the help of the Stones, has, in the words of
                the Telegraph, "changed music" through his contributions to it as a pioneer of the modern music
                industry.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Since their formation in 1962, the Rolling Stones have survived multiple feuds. They have
                released 30 studio albums, 23 live albums, 12 official compilation albums, many recognised
                bootleg recordings, all of which compromise over 340 songs. According to OfficialCharts.com,
                the Stones are ranked the fourth bestselling group of all time. Their top single is "(I Can't Get No)
                Satisfaction", regarded by many at the time as "the classic example of rock and roll". The
                Stones contributed to the blues lexicon, creating their own "codewords" and slang, such as "losing
                streak" for menstrual period, which they have used throughout their catalogue of songs.
                The Stones have gone through at least five stylistic iterations: cover band, '60s pop, '60s acid, '70s
                groove, '80s New Wave. At some point, they lost that elasticity and ability to reinvent and they got old
                but the fact that they did it so well for so long explains their inexhaustible relevance. The Stones
                have lived and died and been reborn again and again. It means that, for many different generations of
                adults, the sound of high school was the Rolling Stones. The Stones have reinvented themselves so many
                times that they might as well be immortal.</p>
